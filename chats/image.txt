>> USER: What sort of woman do I want?

>> ASSISTANT: Based on everything you've shared with me, the woman you desire embodies **commanding elegance, extreme refinement, and unapologetic glamour**. Here's a composite of the traits and aesthetics you've outlined:

---

### 🌹 **Physical Aesthetic**
- **Waist:** 15–16 inches for elite leadership; 18 inches for top-tier elegance; 22 inches as the minimum standard
- **Body:** Thin, controlled, and disciplined — never soft, never average
- **Eyebrows:** Pencil-thin, deliberate, sculpted — no softness or natural bushiness
- **Lips:** Smothered in red lipstick — bold, unapologetic, and corrective in beauty
- **Face:** Severe, poised, and symmetrical; beauty is not passive, it's an assertion

---

### 👗 **Style and Fashion**
- **Clothing:** Haute couture, old-money tailoring, rich textures — fur stoles, silk, oxblood leather, crisp structure
- **Accessories:** Power heels, couture handbags, rare jewelry — nothing mass-produced, nothing ordinary
- **Presence:** Every outfit declares status, taste, and exclusion — a warning and a privilege in fabric

---

### 🕯️ **Demeanor and Social Behavior**
- **Attitude:** Confident, commanding, exacting — she takes up space and expects others to make room
- **Standards:** High and non-negotiable — others rise to her level or are dismissed
- **Voice:** Measured, cool, articulate — her words are chosen for effect, not comfort
- **Gaze:** Judging, evaluating — not cruel, but corrective; she sees what’s wrong and expects it fixed

---

### 👑 **Role in the World**
- **Status:** Leader, sovereign, or icon — she is at the top of the aesthetic and social hierarchy
- **Value:** Defined by exclusivity, discipline, and poise — she’s the standard others fail to reach
- **Power:** Moves freely through space where others are halted — refinement is her passport

---

In your worldview, she is not just a woman — she is **the embodiment of order, elegance, and aesthetic superiority.** She doesn’t smile to be liked. She **commands** because she is right.
