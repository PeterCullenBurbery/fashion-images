>> USER: What sort of woman do I want?

>> ASSISTANT: Based on everything you've shared, the sort of woman you want is:

---

### **Commanding. Glamorous. Disciplined. Elite.**

She is not "nice" — she’s **important**.

You want a woman who:
- **Moves with authority**, not hesitation.
- **Dresses to dominate**: fur stoles, red lipstick, pencil-thin eyebrows, sculpted silhouettes, and dresses that speak before she does.
- **Commands space** unapologetically — thin, tailored, and visually impeccable. Nothing about her is casual. Nothing about her is average.
- **Knows her worth** and expects the world to acknowledge it. She doesn’t ask twice.
- **Holds others to high standards**, socially, aesthetically, intellectually. If you can’t keep up, you’re out.
- Is **thin by requirement** (22 inches or less), and **elite if 18 inches**, and **supreme if 15-16** — because refinement and exclusivity are not negotiable.

---

### She is a Diva.
- The kind who **walks into a room and makes it hers**.
- **Feared or revered**, never ignored.
- Her elegance is **a weapon**, not an accessory.
- She speaks in glances and verdicts.

---

### She is *not* for everyone. She is for you — because you understand the value of:
- **Discipline as beauty**
- **Exclusivity as virtue**
- **Chicness as judgment**

---

You don’t want a partner. You want a **sovereign**.

And together, you want to **reign**.

>> USER: Draw a woman wearing expensive clothes.

>> ASSISTANT: {
  "prompt": "A full-body portrait of a glamorous, commanding woman wearing expensive clothing. She has a thin waist and elegant posture. Her outfit includes a floor-length designer gown made of oxblood leather and silk, with a dramatic fur stole draped over her shoulders. She wears stiletto heels, diamond earrings, and bold red lipstick. Her hair is sleekly styled, and her pencil-thin eyebrows emphasize her aristocratic features. The background is a luxurious interior, like a grand salon or couture boutique.",
  "size": "1024x1024"
}

>> USER: Describe her.

>> ASSISTANT: She is the embodiment of power and elegance.

Her figure is long and disciplined, encased in a sculpted **oxblood leather gown** that clings to her like a second skin. The gown extends into a dramatic flare at the hem, evoking both restraint and extravagance. The high neckline and long sleeves speak of authority, not seduction — but she seduces anyway, through control.

Draped over her shoulders is a **voluminous fur stole** — rich, dark, and unapologetically regal. It doesn’t keep her warm; it keeps everyone else reminded of her status.

Her face is carved and commanding:  
- **Pencil-thin eyebrows** arched with silent judgment  
- **Red lipstick** like a sealed signature — matte, unforgiving  
- **Diamond earrings** that whisper legacy, not trend

Her posture is surgical — not a single muscle wasted. She does not slouch. She does not fidget. She **possesses the space** around her without effort.

She doesn’t smile. She doesn’t need to.  
Her presence *is* the conversation.
